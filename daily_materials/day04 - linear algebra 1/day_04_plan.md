# Day 04 - numerical linear algebra, 1

## Goals for today's class

* Learn about Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting
* Use it to solve systems of linear equations

## Pre-class assignments

* Read about Gaussian elimination w/partial pivoting to get upper triangular matrices
* Code up a function to do Gaussian elimination w/partial pivoting

## In-class activity details

**Plan for the day:** 

Announcements:

* We're going to try something new for next week.  In addition to submitting your pre-class assignment (by the night before!), you should post two questions about the material in the MatterMost channel.  If somebody else posted your question and you want to discuss it, upvote it with a thumbs up.  We'll use that to drive what we do in class.
* We'll do the in-class assignment in small groups - pick one person to do the typing, talk it through together, and backseat drive as that's going on.  You can share a chalkboard/whiteboard somewhere in class. We'll rotate around every day.


### Pre-class assignment

* Have them discuss it and compare notes!
  * We're going to try something new: each group is responsible for putting two questions up today at the end of this discussion.
  * What is gaussian elimination?  What is pivoting?  What about partial pivoting?
  * What is LU decomposition?
* Make sure to talk about class coding standard.  Why am I having them do that?  (My sanity, but also their collaboration, and they'll find it useful in the future.)
* Short presentation on Gaussian elimination

### In-class assignment

* Use code they wrote in the PCA to solve Kirchoff's laws
  * Remind everybody how to solve Kirchoff's laws
  * Spend five minutes at the start to look at it and discuss how it's different from what they did during the pre-class assignment, and how to approach the problem.
  * Reconvene to discuss it briefly.
  * We're going to do the in-class assignment in small groups. Pick one person to do the typing for your group and talk about it through together.  Either everybody can submit the code independently, or just put all of your names on one file (I know who is in which group.)  Make sure to make it clear who was doing the typing!  (Code should be shared with everybody ultimately!

## Instructor notes (for next time)

**Leave feedback on what happened in class today!**

Fall 2018:

* In pre-class assignment, make them write it as a function - tell them they will use it in class.
* The in-class assignment was hugely variable for some students - it took no more than ten or fifteen minutes for some people, but most of the class period for others.  We ended up buying some time/consuming some time be doing the "debugging truths" stuff from the next day.  I need to make a second part of the in-class assignment; maybe have them do something more complex with Gaussian elimination?  maybe have them try to implement LU decomposition?  Big picture, one real challenge with the numerical linear algebra section of the class is that it's pretty tedious to code a lot of these things, but it's really useful.  Maybe add something where they're using SciPy to do numerical linear algebra?  (Or keep that in the homework.)

Spring 2021:

* Pre-class assignment took a long time.  Think about how to sort that out.
