\noindent \textbf{Instructions:}   We're going to re-use the code for
your pre-class assignment, where you used the shooting method to solve
a boundary value problem.  Given the equation:

\begin{equation}
\nabla^2 u = -\pi^2(u-3)
\end{equation}

whose analytic solution has the form 

\begin{equation}
u(x) = \cos(\pi x) + 2 \sin(\pi x) + 3,
\end{equation}

Show that you can calculate the solution using the shooting method on
the interval $[0,1]$ for the initial conditions $u(0) = 4$, $u'(1) =
-2\pi$ as well as the initial conditions $u(1) = 2$, $u'(0) = 2\pi$.
Can you write a general version of the shooting method code that can
take in any arbitrary pair of $u(x)$ and $u'(x)$ values at the
boundaries (one on each side of the interval - either $u$ or $u'$ on
each side, and could be $u$ on both sides, $u'$ on both sides, or a
mixed pair of $u$ and $u'$) and get the correct solution?  Test it by
coming up with a few different few different expressions for $u$ and
verify that it works correctly.  Can you find any analytic expressions
for $u$ that are unsolvable with the shooting method?
