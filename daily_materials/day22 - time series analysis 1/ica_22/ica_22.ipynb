    "In this assignment, we're going to be working with the same time series dataset of a Galactic [low-mass x-ray binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_binary#Low-mass_X-ray_binary), GX 5-1 ([Jonker et al. 2002](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002MNRAS.333..665J)), as we did in the pre-class assignment.  The difference is that in class today we'll be working with the [Lomb-Scargle Periodogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least-squares_spectral_analysis#The_Lomb.E2.80.93Scargle_periodogram), which can be used to extract information from irregularly-spaced time series.\n",
