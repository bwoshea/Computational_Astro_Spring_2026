    "In this pre-class assignment, we're going to be working with a time series dataset of a Galactic [low-mass x-ray binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_binary#Low-mass_X-ray_binary), GX 5-1 ([Jonker et al. 2002](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002MNRAS.333..665J)).  GX 5-1 contains a number of periodic and quasi-periodic behaviors that we can examine with the techniques from Chapter 11 of Feigelson.\n",

The dataset has 65,536 observations, which are contiguous measurements of the number of X-ray counts in intervals of $\\Delta t = 1/128$ seconds for a total of 512 seconds. \n",
