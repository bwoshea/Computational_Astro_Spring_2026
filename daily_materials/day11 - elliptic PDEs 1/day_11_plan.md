# Day 11 - Elliptic PDEs, 1

## Goals for today's class

* Elliptic PDEs, baby.

## Pre-class assignments

* [NOT TRUE IN 2023 - MOVE TO HYPERBOLIC PDES]Read Zingale: Norms, PDE classification, Finite-Volume grids sections
* Pang 7.1-7.5: PDEs, matrix method, relaxation method
* Newman 9.1, 9.2: more PDEs.
* Code up the distorted bench problem w/relaxation method.

## In-class activity details

**Plan for the day:** 

Announcements:

* Second homework out very soon.
* Today we're doing matrix and relaxation methods for elliptic PDEs; this sets us up nicely for the next class, where we'll be learning about the multigrid method for solving elliptic PDEs.

### Pre-class assignment

Get people to discuss it for a few minutes: make a list of questions that you have.  Compare solutions to matrix method w/each other!


Pang reading: matrix method - how to do it?  What challenges did you see?

### In-class assignment

Implement the pre-class assignment (distortion of a bench due to a person sitting in the middle) using the relaxation method rather than the matrix method.  Try doing it using the two different boundary conditions described.

## Instructor notes (for next time)

**Leave feedback on what happened in class today!**

2021: the pre-class assignment and relating discussion went VERY long -  we didn't get to do the in-class assignment.  Instead, we talked through how to implement it and then we moved on.  The students really need to be reminded about notation for space vs. time/iterations (i,n sub and super scripts), which is a real point of contention.
