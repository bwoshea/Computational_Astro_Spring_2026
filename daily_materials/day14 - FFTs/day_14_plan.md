# Day 14 - Fast Fourier Transforms

## Goals for today's class

* Learn about FFTs and understand them as a specific example of a correlation function and as a tool for analyzing time-series data.

## Pre-class assignment

* Chapter 7 of Newman + several related readings that are meant to build up intuition.
* Do some coding and experimentation.

## In-class activity details

**Plan for the day:** 

Announcements:

* Switching over to Feigelson (stats stuff) starting next class.
* Expect HW 1 grades, all PCA and ICA grades, very soon.

### Pre-class assignment

* Share with your group what you did, and discuss the answers to the questions asked in the PCA
* We'll have an in-class discussion about the questions first!
* Also, give a brief presentation on correlation functions and how the FFT works.

### In-class assignment

* Briefly talk about FFTs as a way to analyze data by filtering/templating - it's useful for all sorts of things, and is the basis for many useful analysis techniques.
* We're going to make a band-pass filter and test it.
* Make sure to have a discussion at the end!

## Instructor notes (for next time)

**Leave feedback on what happened in class today!**

2018: Today went REALLY WELL.  I'm very happy with it.

2021: Also went well; next time I will probably keep things as-is.

2023: very happy with it.  Also have students read about cross-correlation functions next time - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation .
