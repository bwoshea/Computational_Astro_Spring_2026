**Make a website for class and put it up ahead of time!**

Introduce students to the Spyder IDE earlier - integrated debugger, etc.  Talk a bit very early in the semester about the various means of programming (Jupyter notebook vs. Spyder or other IDE vs. emacs/vi) and their relative strengths and weaknesses (with respect to, for example, usability on supercomputers, built-in debuggers, etc.)

Next time I really need to work on the numerical linear algebra stuff.  Maybe look at Zingale's notes?  See what homework assignments he has?

## Some thoughts from the end of the semester

I didn't really take advantage of the "notes for next course offering" from when I taught this in 2017:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AfdDsf1tp9qF-Up5cn2MleWNVN125uwKz8YHOFU1tEA/edit .  Definitely go back and look through those!

The revised schedule worked really well this year - I like the ordering of things, and it generally seems to work pretty well.

I should probably distribute the books to the students at the beginning of the semester.

The projects went well, but I would maybe give the students an extra two weeks to get started.  So, go back and figure out the timing to give some extra time (I got distracted and forgot to work out the dates this time around).  

Homework ideas:

* Have the students introduce a faster-convering MCMC algorithm (multiple sampling or adaptive time stepping MCMC) and test it.  Maybe have them try this one?  https://msp.org/camcos/2010/5-1/p04.xhtml  -- Andrey Kravtsov has his students implement it and it works really well.  (It's the algorithm in the emcee code.)  Go back and look at Steven Wright's semester project.
* Make sure to have the students talk about the homework in class after it's turned in.


For next time:

* Make sure I figure out all the hydro stuff; Philipp has taught this the last two times and I could really stand to figure it out.
* Sort out the multigrid method - maybe turn that into a homework assignment?
* Look at Penn State Center for Astrostatistics summer school:  http://astrostatistics.psu.edu/su18/  And use their resources.  This could be helpful!  Also tell students to go check that out in the spring.
* Find more references for machine learning (not just https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), and make sure I have a better idea of the methods.  Have the students read about each of the methods we work through in Jake Vander Plaas's notebooks, or maybe do something else for machine learning!
