    "# In-class assignment: more MCMC\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of today's in-class assignment is to use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique to find the best fit to a poorly-sampled, error-rich time series.  This time series is not amenable to Fourier Transform-based analysis because the data is not uniformly sampled in time and has large and heteroscedastic (i.e., non-uniform) errors, and thus a different technique is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has been provided, and has three columns: sample time (in seconds), flux (in arbitrary units), and error (in the same arbitrary units). You decide that a reasonable model to describe the data is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(t) = A \\sin(\\omega t + \\phi)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Extend the MCMC code used in the pre-class assignment to fit the parameters A, $\\omega$, and $\\phi$, show the 2D histograms of the resulting MCMC trace, and estimate the real answer. Here are a couple of suggestions that might be useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When exploring more dimensions, you generally need to do more sampling to get a reasonable solution.  Try using a minimum of $10^5$ samples in your Markov Chain - $10^6$ would be better if your computer can handle it.\n",
    "2. Make sure to use the errors given to you in the file for this assignment - don't guess!\n",
    "3. You do not have to use equal steps in each direction in parameter space.  In other words, $\\Delta A$, $\\Delta\\omega$ and $\\Delta\\phi$ do not all have to be equally sized.  Think about which one probably has the most range, and make that one largest!\n",
    "4. You also don't necessarily need to take steps where $\\Delta A, \\Delta\\omega,\\Delta\\phi$ are uniformly distributed (using, e.g., `np.random.uniform()`).  Experiment with using a Gaussian distribution (via `np.random.normal()`) for the same values of $\\Delta$ and see how it impacts convergence!  Note that you may need to smooth the errors measured in the trace to tell the difference between the two algorithms.  See [the SciPy Coookbook's signal-smoothing example](https://scipy-cookbook.readthedocs.io/items/SignalSmooth.html) for some code you can copy and paste.\n",
