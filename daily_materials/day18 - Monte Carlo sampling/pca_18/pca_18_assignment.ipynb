    "The main goal of this pre-class assignment is to use [Monte carlo integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_integration) - a  technique for numerical integration that uses random numbers to compute the value of a definite integral.  Monte Carlo integration works well for one-dimensional functions, but is much more computationally costly than its more deterministic counterparts (i.e., the trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule, etc.).  Monte Carlo integration is particularly useful for high-dimensional integrals and/or complicated functions, though - those are often hard to calculate exactly, and must be approximated to solve the problem in a sensible amount of computational time."

    "**Your assignment:** Write a code, implemented as a function, that uses Monte Carlo (MC) integration to integrate an arbitrary one-dimensional function that is given to it as an argument.  Take also as arguments the beginning and end points over which you wish to integrate, the minimum and maximum values of f (i.e., the y-bounds of the integration box) and the number of sample points to use. \n",

    "We will use as two test cases (1) the function $f_1(x) = 2 x^2 + 3$, integrated from $x_{beg}= -2$ to $x_{end} = +4$, and (2) the function $f_2(x) = 3 x^3 + 5$, integrated from $x_{beg}= -3$ to $x_{end} = +2$.  Their analytic solutions are 66 and -23.75, respectively.\n",

    "As you increase the number of samples ($N_{sample}$) from 10 to $10^6$ by factors of 10, how does your calculated solution approach the true answer?  In other words, calculate the fractional error, defined as $\\epsilon = |\\frac{I - T}{T}|$, where I is the integrated answer and T is the true (i.e., analytic) answer.  Make a log-log plot of the error as a function of the number of samples, and compare it to the expected error of $\\epsilon \\sim N_{sample}^{-1/2}$.  You only need to do this once per value of $N_{sample}$; **however, if you have time you should do it several times to get an idea of the variation in error for a number of samples!**\n",
