# Day 18 - Monte Carlo sampling

## Goals for today's class

* Understand Monte Carlo as a sampling technique
* Experiment with Monte Carlo integration and Monte Carlo sampling

## Pre-class assignments

* Read Owen chapters 1 and 2
* Jupyter notebook on Monte Carlo integration

## In-class activity details

**Plan for the day:**

### Pre-class assignment

First, get everybody to compare their codes!

Questions/discussion:

* Monte Carlo as a sampling technique
* How did the Monte Carlo integration go?
* How do computers generate (pseudo)random numbers?  Are they actually random?  What does that mean?  (Give a brief presentation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator)  In practice, this is not an issue any more but if you use Unix the system random number generator should be viewed with suspicion.  Mersenne Twister (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister) is the PRNG used in Python and R (and Excel, Matlab, etc.) and is more than sufficient for almost all needs.

### In-class assignment

Monte Carlo and the stellar IMF - we're going to make some distributions, and experiment with using Monte Carlo modeling to estimate uncertainties due to things we don't understand.

Let's spend ten or fifteen minutes running through the code that's in the ICA, and go from there.

## Instructor notes (for next time)

**Leave feedback on what happened in class today!**

Spring 2021: Make sure to have the students look at the wikipedia page on pseudo-random number generators as part of their pre-class assignment next year:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator .  (Note: I already updated the pre-class assignment.)  Also, this went pretty well!
