# Day 27 - machine learning 1

## Goals for today's class

* Discuss and think about machine learning (VERY high-level overview)

## Pre-class assignments


Read Chapter 9 from Feigelson (Clustering, classification, data mining)

Work through Jupyter notebook on k-means clustering methods w/both fake and real data

## In-class activity details

**Plan for the day:** Talk about pre-class assignment, then we're going to work through the Vander Plaas notebooks.

Announcements:

* Project final code and writeup due Sunday 12/9/2018
* Project presentations and code demonstrations due 10:00 a.m. on 12/12/2018 
* Discussion: early lunch on final exam day!
* Also, who would actually come to a presentation on methods for hydro, etc.?  (grid vs. particle vs. moving-mesh)

### Pre-class assignment

Discussion questions:

* What were your big takeaways from Chapter 9?
* What did you learn from k-means clustering?  How does it behave as you increase the size of each blob?  (They should start blending together...)
* Did other clustering methods work better?  At what point do they all fail?  (Refer to web page on this:  https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html)
 
### In-class assignment

Plan:  Work through VanderPlas "An intro to Scikit-learn" notebooks, getting through Notebook 3.1.  Stop to touch base every once in a while to discuss the various methods.

Points to make:

* We're going to work through these tutorials as a very brief overview of machine learning
* I strongly encourage you to look at the book "Statistics, Data Mining, and Machine Learning in Astronomy"
* CMSE offers a class every fall entitled "Mathematical Foundations of Data Science," and there are a bunch of classes in PHY, CMSE, CSE, STT, and MTH on various subjects relating to this (for example, data mining, Bayesian statistics, sampling methods) - **CMSE will be offering an Applied Machine Learning class next year**, as well as a **Mathematics of Deep Learning** class (and CSE will be offering a **Deep Learning Methods** class.
* There are several programs for people interested in learning more about data science:
  * LSST Data Science graduate fellowship: 2 year program, Carl Fields is in it.  Applications are available once a year:  https://astrodatascience.org/
  * Insight fellowship for people who plan to go into industry after their PhD (it's a postdoctoral program):  https://www.insightdatascience.com/.  There are fairly regular deadlines, and the program is 7 weeks long.

## Instructor notes (for next time)

**Leave feedback on what happened in class today!**

This went fine.  The tutorial stuff was OK, but not great - there's a lot going on here.  Next time, have the students download and work through everything before class!  (So there's less to fight through in class.)
