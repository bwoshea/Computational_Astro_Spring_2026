# Pre-class assignment day 15

This pre-class assignment is due midnight before the day of class.

## Coding assignment
- Finish the implementation of the MUSCL-Hancock scheme we started in class
- Demonstrate the successful implementation by recovering the original solution plot at t = 0.2.
- Add your final notebook to the repository. We'll use it in class for further exploration.

## Writing assignment
Day 15 will conclude the hyperbolic PDE and computational fluid dynamics part of the class.
Therefore, it's a good time to revisit what you've learned so far.

Please go back to all pre-class and in-class assignments and to what we discussed in class 
(ideally based on the notes you took), and write a coherent summary (4000 - 5000 characters).
The summary should address the main concepts that we covered (e.g., but not limited to, linear and 
nonlinear PDEs, systems of PDEs, CFL factor, stability, numerical diffusion, Godunov method,
the Riemann problem and solvers, characteristics, limiting, higher-order methods, equation of state, 
etc.) and how they are connected.

Please submit in a format that can directly be read on Github, e.g., markdown document or pdf.


## Reading assignment
In order to prepare for the CFD homework, we'll spend some time in class to discuss the
changes in your code that are required to make it multi-dimensional.

Therefore, please read the sections in Toro that are mentioned in the homework assignment and
think about how the content transfers to your implementation.

This is your chance to get a head start with the homework assignment. 
The more you and your classmates are discussing in class, the less you have to face these issues yourself.
