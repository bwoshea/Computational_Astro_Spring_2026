    "# Day 11  - Hyperbolic PDEs Part I - Linear Advection\n",
    "\n",
    "This three part module covers solving hyperbolic PDEs and is structured as follows:\n",
    "- Part 1: Linear advection and first order finite difference schemes\n",
    "- Part 2: Conservative formulation and flux/slope limiting\n",
    "- Part 3: Nonlinear equations and the Riemann problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Each part will be covered in one class, i.e., this module spans 1.5 weeks total.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal of this module\n",
    "This module serves as the basis for the following computational fluid dynamics module in which we will solve the Euler equations.\n",
    "The Euler equations are a system of nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs.\n",
    "In order to build a fundamental understand of how to solve that kind of complex system, we will go step-by-step from a single linear hyperbolic PDE  (the linear advection equation) to a nonlinear PDE (here, Burgers equation).\n",
    "After finishing this module, you'll be able to use different methods to solve PDEs and understand their advantages, disadvantages, and general behavior.\n",
    "From a practise point of view, this (and the following module) will illustrate how to write modular and adaptable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-class assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "***The pre-class assignment is due midnight before the class!***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal of this pre-class assignment\n",
    "- Understand the linear advection equation and its solution\n",
    "- Implement two first order finite difference schemes to solve the linear advection equation and explain their behavior and fundamental differences\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "First, get the (quite exhaustive) \"Introduction\" Riemann Solvers and Numerical Methods for Fluid Dynamics A Practical Introduction by Eleuterio F. Toro at http://link.springer.com/978-3-540-49834-6 (access from within MSU network or via proxy).\n",
    "\n",
    "Side note: You can get actual print copies of all springer books (that are available as ebooks on link.springer.com) for just 25 USD.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this and the next module I (Philipp) prefer this resource for its modularity and accessibility (if you read the text carefully). As you'll see, a lot of general ideas are repeated and cross referenced in the beginning of chapters/sections, which helps to put previous ideas in light of the current concept.\n",

    "#### Reading assignments\n",
    "- Section 2.2 The Linear Advection Equation\n",
    "- Section 5.1 Discretisation: Introductory Concepts\n",
    "- Section 5.2 Selected Difference Schemes\n",
    "- Section 5.5.1 Sample Numerical Results - Linear Advection\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Coding assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the forward in time, centered in space method (FTCS, eq. 5.12) and the upwind method (eq. 5.16).\n",
    "Write your code in such a modular way that, starting from one method, the implementation of the second method only adds about 2 lines of code.\n",
    "The simulation needs to be periodic, so that the advected signal that leaves the simulation domain on one end, enters again from the other end.\n",
    "Implement an initial condition generator (or function) that can generate both smooth (eq. 5.110) and discontinuous (eq. 5.111) initial conditions as described in Sec. 5.5.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now solve the linear advection equation using $N = 100$ grid points with both methods and for both initial conditions, and plot the results after $t = 0.2, 1.0, 2.0, 20.0$ (corresponding to 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 10 periods)."
