    "# Day 12  - Hyperbolic PDEs Part II - Conservative formulation and nonlinear equations\n",
    "\n",
    "This three part module covers solving hyperbolic PDEs and has been restructuredas follows:\n",
    "- Part 1: Linear advection and first order finite difference schemes\n",
    "- Part 2: Conservative formulation and nonlinear equations\n",
    "- Part 3: The Riemann problem and flux/slope limiting\n",
    "\n",
    "Each part will be covered in one class, i.e., this module spans 1.5 weeks total.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal of this module\n",
    "This module serves as the basis for the following computational fluid dynamics module in which we will solve the Euler equations.\n",
    "The Euler equations are a system of nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs.\n",
    "In order to build a fundamental understand of how to solve that kind of complex system, we will go step-by-step from a single linear hyperbolic PDE  (the linear advection equation) to a nonlinear PDE (here, Burgers equation).\n",
    "After finishing this module, you'll be able to use different methods to solve PDEs and understand their advantages, disadvantages, and general behavior.\n",
    "From a practise point of view, this (and the following module) will illustrate how to write modular and adaptable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-class assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "***The pre-class assignment is due midnight before the class!***\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in class this week, the preclass assignments are an important and essential component of the entire class (not only this module).\n",
    "Thus, you're expected to make a best effort in addressing all questions/tasks on time and failure to do so will affect your grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a technical point of view, all plots and answers should be contained in this notebook.\n",
    "In other words, the only file you should commit to the repository is this notebook.\n",
    "Finally, make sure that you submit a fully functioning notebook, i.e., before submission hit \"Kernel - Restart & Run All\".\n",
    "Again, if you experience technical difficulties with jupyter notebooks that are not solved by a quick internet search, contact Philipp or the class' channel via Slack.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal of this pre-class assignment\n",
    "- Understand differences (e.g., with respect to order and numerical diffusity) in using different methods to solve the linear advection equation\n"
