# PCA summary

- everyone who submitted code got the correct solution
- some people still struggle with task, address that separately
- most questions on TVD

## Questions
- Are there schemes that quantify error not by the local truncation error, but by a global metric? [in practice this is done, e.g., by linear advection, cf. ODE session]
- What are other examples of Total Variation Stable methods? [this will be covered in the next classes]


## Annoucement 
- next session CFD, 
- MUSCL-Hancock
- PCA for next week, mostly reading and looking at code
