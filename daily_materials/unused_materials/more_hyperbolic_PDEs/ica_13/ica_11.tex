\noindent \textbf{Instructions:}  In today's class we are going to
discuss and implement the 2$^{nd}$ order finite-volume solver for
Burgers' equation, as discussed in Chapter 5 of Zingale's lecture
notes.   Test it for two sets of initial conditions, and verify that
they behave in agreement with Figures 5.3 and 5.4 in Zingale.  In both
cases, use a domain that goes from $0 \leq x \leq 1$ with $N_g = 100$
grid points.

\noindent Initial condition \#1 (rarefaction):  $u(x,t=0) = 1$ for $ x < 1/2$ and $u(x,t=0) = 2$ for $ x \geq 1/2$

\vspace{5mm}

\noindent Initial condition \#2 (shock):  $u(x,t=0) = 1$ for $ x < 1/3$ and $x
> 2/3$, and  $u(x,t=0) = 1 + \frac{1}{2}\sin(\frac{2\pi(x-1/3)}{1/3})$
for $1/3 \leq x \leq 2/3$.
