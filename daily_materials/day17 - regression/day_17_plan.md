# Day 17 - Regression

## Goals for today's class

* Learn about regression and how you do it
* Practice nonlinear regression in class!

## Pre-class assignments

* Read Chapter 7
* Write a bit of code to do linear regression

## In-class activity details

**Plan for the day:** 

Announcements:

* Next week is all about Monte Carlo - that's one of my favorite topics!  So incredibly useful!

### Pre-class assignment

* Discuss with your neighbors, and also compare results of your codes
* What questions do you have? 

Some questions to ask:

* What is regression?
* Why is regression useful in astronomy?
* Why use weighted least squares over least squares?  When would you use one vs. the other?
* How do "measurement error models" work?  
* How does nonlinear model regression work differently than linear regression?
* When you are attempting to select and validate models, what are some of the things you need to take into account?

Some points to make:

* Use least squares and weighted least-squares whenever possible
* Bootstrap error analysis is very helpful - gives you a sense of what your model variations are!
* Anscombe's Quartet (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet) is a really good example of why you might want to look at your data as well as just measure residuals and adjusted residuals.

### In-class assignment

* Nonlinear regression and model validation (7.6, 7.7 of Feigelson and Babu)


## Instructor notes (for next time)

**Leave feedback on what happened in class today!**

2021: went well!  most people got the fit to work in the ICA, but didn't do the k-fold cross-validation.
