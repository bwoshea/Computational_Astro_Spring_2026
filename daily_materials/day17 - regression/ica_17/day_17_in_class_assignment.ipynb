    "# Day 17 project - non-linear regression\n",

    "In today's in-class assignment, we're going to experiment with nonlinear models - specifically, using some models of galaxy surface brightness.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's typical to model elliptical galaxies using a [Sérsic profile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sersic_profile), which is an expression of the surface brightness galaxy as a function of impact parameter from its center.  The mathematical form is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\log_{10}I(r) = \\log_{10} I_e - b_n [(r/r_e)^{1/n} - 1]$,\n",
    "\n",
    "with I$_e$ being the central intensity, r$_e$ being an effective radius (usually measured in arc seconds), and the parameter n, called the \"Sérsic index,\" controlling the curvature of the profile (with profiles having larger values of n being more centrally concentrated).  In this expression, $b_n \\simeq 0.868n -0.142$ for ranges of n that are relevant for most elliptical galaxies.  The observed surface brightness profile is calculated from the Sérsic profile as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mu(r) = \\mu_0 - 2.5 \\log_{10}I(r)$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mu_0$ is a quantity that encapsulates the distance modulus and other quantities (see [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(astronomy)) to remind yourself about how magnitudes work).\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to use a SciPy nonlinear regression tool to calculate the parameters for the Sérsic profile for three elliptical galaxies:  \n",
    "[Messier 49 (NGC 4472)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_49),\n",
    "[Messier 86 (NGC 4406)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_86), and\n",
    "[NGC 4551](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_4551).  Data files are included for these three clusters that record the surface brightness (in units of mag arcsec$^{-2}$) as a function of radius on the sky in arc seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, make a line plot of the surface brightness profiles of the three galaxies, and make sure that they make sense to you.  Use numpy's [genfromtxt()](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.1/reference/generated/numpy.genfromtxt.html) method to read the data from each file into two separate arrays!"

Make your best guess at the parameters of this for one of the three elliptical galaxies above, and see how good a job you can do manually fitting the data using a \"chi-by-eye\" fit by twiddling the parameters.
