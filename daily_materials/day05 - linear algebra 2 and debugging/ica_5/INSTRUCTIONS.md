# In-class assignment instructions

There is a broken Python code, crashing\_program.py, 
in this directory.  It has two bugs in it.  Using the 
Python debugger (pdb), the IPython debugger (ipdb), or 
any other debugger you want, find those two bugs, fix them, and 
report them in the ANSWERS.md file.

Note: the correct answers are:

Root: 5.03046887, which the secant method should find in approximately 9 iterations.

Integral from 0 to root listed above:  8.224337, which the trapezoidal rule should convert to in about 12 iterations.
