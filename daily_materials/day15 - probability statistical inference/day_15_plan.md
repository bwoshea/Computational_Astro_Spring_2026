# Day 15 - probability and statistical inference

## Goals for today's class

* Review basics of probability and statistical inference, in preparation for the rest of our astrostatistics journey

## Pre-class assignment

* Read Ch. 2, 3.1-3.7 of Feigelson (Probability, Statistical Inference)
* Answer several questions, including listing questions for things that people don't understand

## In-class activity details

**Plan for the day:** 

Announcements:

* Grading pre-class, in-class stuff soon; all grades will be up after the weekend!

### Pre-class assignment

Get everybody to get together in small groups and talk about the chapters.  What are the key points?  What makes sense, and what did they struggle with?  What questions do they have, and what do they want to talk about further?  (Encourage students to answer each others' questions).

After discussion: Get students to answer questions: round-robin.



### In-class assignment

Points to make:

* Statistics as applied to astronomy is tremendously broad, and there's absolutely no way we can discuss everything here.  **My main goal this semester is to give you a sense of what is out there, how to use the fundamental tools and concepts, and where to look for more advanced or specialized things.**  I'll be giving you several resources (usually PDFs of books that are downloadable via the MSU library) that may be useful to you down the road.

* Don't panic!  There's a lot of jargon, and a lot of details.  This is why we have textbooks and Google.  You can always go back and remind yourself of what stuff is (chapters 2 and 3 are particularly full of this!)

* Make sure to tell people about Wasserman's book - it's a very useful resource!  Feigelson recomends it quite a bit, and you should hang onto it as a reference.

Questions:

* What are the challenges of using statistics in astronomy?
  * Must assume underlying distribution function (typically continuous, possibly not) from discrete objects or events
  * Must generally assume a model when making estimates or interpreting data
  * Must use limited samples / limited numbers of measurements with a strong selection function.
* How is statistics used in astronomy?

Activity: get individual students to talk about stuff!


## Instructor notes (for next time)

**Leave feedback on what happened in class today!**

2021: For next year, make sure to point the students to the Wasserman textbook -- it's now in the PCA directory.
