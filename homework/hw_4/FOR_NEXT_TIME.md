# Homework #4 

For next time:

* Fix the way that error bars are calculated for the galaxy luminosity function problem.  This was absolutely screwed up the first time around - the error bars were WAY TOO BIG and thus the problem didn't actually constrain anything.  I had to give an amended problem that had way simpler error bars.  Also, note that the file luminosity\_schechter.py now has a fixed version of the problem.
