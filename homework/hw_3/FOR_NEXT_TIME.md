# Homework #3 

For next time:

* Clarify that the code should be in text files, adhere to coding standards, and pass PyLint tests.  (This is true of all of the stuff.)
* For the Traveling Salesman problem, I'm currently using Blue Waters as the example.  I should use Frontier (exascale supercomputer) as the example instead.
* For problem 4 (the stats problem) tell them to use at least two fundamentally different statistical techniques!
