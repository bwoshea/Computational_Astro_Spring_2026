# Homework #1

Fall 2018 comments:

Improvements I'd make for next time: 

Overall - make it clear to students that I'm not joking about commenting.  Make sure to tell them to think about when plots should have log axes vs. linear axes (anything where we're asking about error usually means log axes)

125 years is probably the wrong integration time.  Double-check this!

Part 1.2: hint that this might want a log-log plot.

1.3: students had a really have time with this.  Only about half got it.

part 2: pretty much fine.  In terms of points, this is worth far less than the first part!

Spring 2023:

Revised the homework quite a bit.

For next year - update grading rubric to include requirement to use pytest and have a test runner!  (for the testing question).  Make this clearer in that problem.

Make sure to ask students to report how much time they spent on each part.

Also update the time that the students should run everything.  The comet's orbital period is shorter than I thought it was.

**Tell students to check in with me if they spend too much time on the homework**.  This is really important - some of the students are spending WAY too much time on it.
