# Homework #2 

For next time:

* make sure to tell students to put things in Python text files, not notebooks!  Also make it clear that the code needs to look OK for PyLint.

For question 2.4, next time I need to be clearer that this should describe the dynamical evolution of the stars in the cluster, rather than just saying "evolution".  This is prone to misinterpretation.

For question 2.2 tell them to make a log-log plot of potential vs. distance.  

For question 1, tell them to plot an error proportional to -2 line on there and comment on it.

For the thermal conduction question, ask some leading questions about boundary conditions - what should the inner and outer boundary conditions do?  What should the minima and maxima be?

Make sure to ask students to report how much time they spent on each part.

For the gravitational potential question, make sure to give the students a hint about units - if G is in CGS, dx and rho have to be in CGS as well!  (and the make_star_array method does return the stellar densities in CGS!)
