# Semester wrap-up, Spring 2021

**Due date:**  This assignment is due by the end 
of finals week, **Friday, May 5th.**

## Instructions

In lieu of a final exam, I'd like you to spend a bit of time reflecting 
on what you've learned in this class and how it might be useful to you 
in the future.  The idea is for you to synthesize and summarize your 
thoughts about the course, but don't spend too much time on it.  **Please 
don't spend more than an hour on this entire assignment!**  To be clear, 
there are not right or wrong answers here - I just want to hear your 
thoughts about what you've learned from this class!

## Questions

**Question 1:** Please take a bit of time to look back through the various 
pre-class and in-class assignments before answering this question!  What 
were the most interesting and/or important things that you've learned from 
this class?

*Put your answer here!*

**Question 2:** When you think about the arc of the entire semester, what 
were the broad themes that emerged from the topics that we've explored?  
In other words, what were your key "big picture" takeaways from this class 
in terms of numerical and statistical methods?  (Note that I'm not looking
for specific topics here - I'm really looking for a synthesis of the 
overarching themes you took away from the course.)

*Put your answer here!*

**Question 3:** How do you think what you've learned in this class will be 
useful to you in the future?  (Other than making you a real challenge for 
seminar speakers during the Q&A, that is.)

*Put your answer here!*

**Question 4:**  What topics did you learn about in this class that you would 
have liked us to spend more time on, or topics that we didn't cover that you 
wish we had done?

*Put your answer here!*

**Question 5:**  What are your plans for the summer, both for work and personally?

*Put your answer here!*

**Question 6:**  (Technically not an actual question.)  Please take a few 
minutes to fill out the online SIRS form (found at 
[https://sirsonline.msu.edu/](https://sirsonline.msu.edu/) ) 
so I can get your feedback on how the class went!  In the free-response area 
of the SIRS form, I usually ask students to answer three questions:

1. What aspects of the class helped you learn the materials?
2. What aspects of class could I improve next time I teach this class?
3. Do you have any other comments about this class, or suggestions for how I can improve my teaching?

It would be great if you could answer those, or some subset of them, because
the written feedback on my teaching is a lot more useful to me than the numerical
ratings.

*Don't put your answers here - please fill out the SIRS form!*

**Have a great summer!**
